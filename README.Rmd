# distplot

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of `distplot` is to make it easy to generate density plots of common statistical distributions including shading area(s) under the curve and adding line segments. These are especially useful for teaching statistics courses, producing visual examples of different types of problems and solutions.   


## Installation

You can install the development version of distplot from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("tarball11/distplot")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(distplot)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
